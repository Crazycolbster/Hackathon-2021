# Death Comes for Us All

## A tiny top-down shooter in Godot 3.2

This is a single level top-down shooter built in Godot.  The initial inspiration to work on this came from watching a video by Eli Cuaycong called [Make a 2D TOP-DOWN SHOOTER in just 10 MINUTES (Godot Game Engine)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HycyFNQfqI0).  I spent considerably longer than 10 minutes on it.
