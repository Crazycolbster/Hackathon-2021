# Smoke Jumper Hero

## A tiny top-down firefighting game in Godot 3.2

This is a single level top-down shooter built in Godot.  The initial inspiration to work on this came from watching a video by Eli Cuaycong called [Make a 2D TOP-DOWN SHOOTER in just 10 MINUTES (Godot Game Engine)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HycyFNQfqI0).  I spent considerably longer than 10 minutes on it.


## Todo

 - [ ] Music and Sound Effects
 - [ ] Create a title screen - Curtis 
 - [ ] Create an in-game pause menu - Curtis
 - [ ] Change projectiles to water
 - [ ] Change enemies to gradually growing fire
 - [ ] Create a tutorial (artistic vision: character moving on a black background with text introducing them and their controls)
